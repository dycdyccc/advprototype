        <h2 class="" style="font-style:italic">What do Prototypes Prototype?
            Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >"Much current terminology centers on attributes of prototypes themselves: the tools used to create them, or how refined-looking or -behaving they are. Yet tools can be used in many different ways, and resolution can be misleading. We have proposed a shift in attention to focus on questions about the design of the artifact itself: What role will it play in a users life? How should it look and feel? How should it be implemented?"</p>
        <p> Response: As the writer points out two major parts of a project: the “look and feel” and the “Implementation”. Attributes of prototype are what designers pay the most attention to during design process. How a prototype looked and how it’s working seem to be the results of the project which should not be determined so much during the design process early one. Instead, focus on the fundamental part of the project, why a product should be created in the first place and what is it doing in our life.
        </p>


        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >"Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions. Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions. If the artifact is to provide new functionality for users—and thus play a new role in their lives—the most important questions may concern exactly what that role should be and what features are needed to support it. If the role is well understood, but the goal of the artifact is to present its functionality in a novel way, then prototyping must focus on how the artifact will look and feel." </p>
        <p>Response: During my own working progress I often got stuck during certain phases. Especially during the “look and feel” the design choices become really vague when I shifted focus to the color palette itself and forgetting the goal of the overall design. Now I find it very helpful to always trace back to the fundamental question during each design phases.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >"Given a design problem (of any scope or size), designers can use the model to separate design issues into three classes of questions which frequently demand different approaches to prototyping. Implementation usually requires a working system to be built; look and feel requires the concrete user experience to be simulated or actually created; role requires the context of the artifact’s use to be established."</p>
        <p>Response:Sometimes a project needs to meet these three questions, the role of the product, the look and feel and it’s implementation. It gets overwhelming trying to achieve all of them at the same time, and even just thinking about how the measure the success of these three aspects. This method is really helpful for designers to achieve efficiency and clarity."

            Rune Madsen</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >“The fundamental problem with this approach is that static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems. Even in web design where the page metaphor is still prevalent, it seems limiting to define the design to just the styles of the page. Is google.com a good website because of the look of the search field?”</p>
        <p>I often find myself limiting design approaches when working on the visual part of the design such as designing a typographic poster. This quote makes me realize that we are working with a much more flexible system because of the digitalization, and there are more aspects can be taken into consideration for better results.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >“Variations of a design can be tested much faster during the prototyping phase, and randomization can be used to reveal designs that the designer would never have created with a pencil. Third, it enables designers to create dynamic systems that can change their designs based on time, place, or use.”</p>
        <p>This randomization is not only helpful during the prototyping phase. What a digital system is also really good at is to reproduce according to a particular system. As templates have been increasingly prevalent on the internet today, more and more designs tend to be very predictable. Finding something unique and be amazed are becoming rare. In this case, digital system could provide varieties of option for designers to explore vast design opportunities.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >“Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process.”</p>
        <p>It is important to define the design on a macro level before dive into the micro details. Design systems create certain constraints for designers stay in line while making variations that are cohesive.</p>

            Adam Greenfield</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >“At the most intimate scale, the internet of things manifests in the form of wearable biometric sensors: devices that collect the various traces of our being in the world, and submit them to the network for inspection and analysis.”</p>
        <p>About ten years ago, technology was mainly used in an environment outside of us such as the traffic, news and media. Later on, technology started get closer involved with our life: it enters our home which is a more intimate space. I find myself conformably accepting smart home when it was  introduced few years ago. Now technology measures data from our inner body, and wearable technology sticks to our body sometimes over 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >“If wearable biometric devices are aimed, however imperfectly, at rigorous self-mastery, the colonization of the domestic environment by similarly networked products and services is intended to deliver a very different experience: convenience.”
        </p>
        <p>When smart phone was invented, we never thought it could be making so much impact on our decision making later on. It is really interesting when technology at first was helping us to achieve efficiency, and now it becomes a much more deeper level which the author used the word “self-mastery.” Google also brought out the importance of “digital wellbeing” few years ago.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119)" >
            “Against the backdrop of late capitalism, the rise of wearable biometric monitoring can only be understood as a disciplinary power traversing the body itself and all its flows. This is a power that Frederick Taylor never dreamed of, and Foucault would have been laughed out of town for daring to propose.”</p>
        <p>Technology somewhat helps human get closer to the fact and truth about everything. As an UX designer, It is really fun to see that we always refer to human psychology when we design, and somehow many technologies are invented to helps us understanding more about human.</p>
